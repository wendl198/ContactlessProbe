# ContactlessProbe

This is meant to have all the code that I have compiled that may be useful for the contactless probe. Most of the code was written by myself, but I (Blake Wendland) must give credit to Jack Zwettler and Dinesh Shukla for code that I started with and then modified. Thanks to Zach Anderson for some random advise and brain storming sessions as well.

DataAcquisition folder should have everything that you will need in order to run the probe. 

There are assorted tutorials and SOPs available in this google drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NYYNq_5F3oWOElOhdVvI6J9_ZByNiAqg?usp=sharing
